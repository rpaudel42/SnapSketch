# SnapSketch

Unsupervised general-purpose graph sketching technique  that can represent a snapshot of a graph stream at any time t into a fixed-size sketch vector.
The graph representations learned by snapsketch can be used for downstream applications, such as graph classification, anomaly detection, community detection, etc.
